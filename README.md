```
2. Activate environment `cre_biomedical`
```
conda activate cre_biomedical
```
3. Install packages

# How to run
- Config arguments in file `run.sh` \
  ID: experiment's ID \
  Corpus_list: List tasks \
  MEMORY_SIZE: memory size
- Run following command in terminal
```
./run.sh
```

# Result for experiment ID
- Model's performance are saved to folder `result\detail_performance\continual_{ID}` \
  Performance after training `i` task [T_1, T_2, ..., T_i] is saved to folder `result\continual_{ID}\detail_performance\{i}`
- Model is saved to folder file `result\save_model\model_{ID}`
- Memorized samples is saved to file `result\save_memorized_samples\memory_{ID}.pkl`
- Log during training is saved to file `result\detail_training\training_performance_{ID}.txt`
